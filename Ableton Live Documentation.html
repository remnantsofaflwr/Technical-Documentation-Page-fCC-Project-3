            <p>Live is a fast, fluid and flexible software for music creation and performance. 
                It comes with effects, instruments, sounds and all kinds of creative features—everything you need to make any kind of music.
                Create in a traditional linear arrangement, or improvise without the constraints of a timeline in Live’s Session View. 
                Move freely between musical elements and play with ideas, without stopping the music and without breaking your flow.</p>

            <p>Session and Arrangement view are the two main UI setups for its creators. Here's the differences between them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In Session View you can freely mix and match musical ideas without the constraints of a timeline. 
                    Getting ideas down is lightning fast, and it's the ideal place for improvisation. 
                    You can play MIDI and audio loops of different lengths in any combination, without ever stopping the music.</li>
                <li>
                    The Arrangement View is where you can organize music along a timeline. Record multiple passes of an audio or MIDI performance into individual takes. 
                    Find the best parts of each and stitch them together for the desired final result.

            <p>Max for Live is a platform to build your own instruments and effects, tools for live performance and visuals, and much more. All in Ableton.
                You can open up any of Live's Max devices, see how they're built, and change them to meet your needs. You can build your own from scratch using the same components. 
                And you can even use Max to change the way Live works, including the properties of tracks, clips and scenes.</p>

        <header>Ableton Note</header>
        <p> The Note is a playable iOS app for forming musical ideas; on the go and on the fly. It'ss a place to start ideas, experiment with sounds and find direction. 
            Wether you're creating for fun, or starting the next summer anthem, when you combine the Note with Ableton Cloud, you can send your Note Set to your Live set without leaving the app. 
            Then keep working with all the same devices as in Note, but with additional parameters available. You're able to edit all your MIDI notes, and all your samples and sounds. 
            Directly from Note. Without a change. </p>
